## Pocketbook Color e-reader Exploration

** Notice: This is not Pocketbook Inkpad! Pocketbook Color is older version of Pocketbook Inkpad, as far as I know the display, battery and the USB C has been upgraded to the Pocketbook Color but Processor and RAM might be the same **

There's seems to be a UART connection at the board however, I have not tried this port myself yet.

As observed we see a 3.3v, TX, RX and GND connection to the board.
